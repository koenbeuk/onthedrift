One way of managing this growing complexity is by leveraging triggers. Essentially this means that weâ€™re able to run arbitrary code whenever a database commit occurs. Luckily for us, EF Core already provides the necessary infrastructure to embrace triggers. All we need to add is a bit of plumbing. EntityFrameworkCore.Triggered is a NuGet package that does just that. The source can be found over on Github.</description></item><item><title>Activator utilities: activate anything!</title><link>https://www.onthedrift.com/posts/activator-utilities/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>koen@linker.io (Koen)</author><guid>https://www.onthedrift.com/posts/activator-utilities/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dependency injection (DI) is a well-known technique that helps in writing more maintainable code. .NET has excellent support for Dependency injection and is heavily used in platforms such as ASP.NET Core. However, did you know there is a way to automatically instantiate a type with constructor arguments provided from an IServiceProvider without having to register that type with the DI Container first? That&amp;rsquo;s where &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilities?view=dotnet-plat-ext-5.0">ActivatorUtilities&lt;/a> comes in.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
