This however has its limitations as you as a developer will have likely encountered. EFCore is only able to handle expressions that are typed as such. As a result, if you try to select anything from a locally computed property or method then EFCore will have to fall back to client-side evaluation to compute the result of that expression which may be inefficient and is certainly limiting!</description></item></channel></rss>
