This however has its limitations as you as a developer will have likely encountered. EFCore is only able to handle expressions that are typed as such. As a result, if you try to select anything from a locally computed property or method then EFCore will have to fall back to client-side evaluation to compute the result of that expression which may be inefficient and is certainly limiting!</description></item><item><title>Triggers for Entity Framework Core</title><link>https://www.onthedrift.com/posts/efcore-triggered-part1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>koen@linker.io (Koen)</author><guid>https://www.onthedrift.com/posts/efcore-triggered-part1/</guid><description>When our codebase grows, so does its complexity. One way of managing this growing complexity is by leveraging triggers. Essentially this means that weâ€™re able to run arbitrary code whenever a database commit occurs. Luckily for us, EF Core already provides the necessary infrastructure to embrace triggers. All we need to add is a bit of plumbing. EntityFrameworkCore.Triggered is a NuGet package that does just that. The source can be found over on Github.</description></item></channel></rss>
